# Wealth of Nations Data Visualisation

The aim of this project was to analyse how wealth (GDP), life expectancy, and smartphone usage are connected in different countries. I used **Excel** to clean and prepare the data, password protecting the file to ensure data safety.

I then used **Tableau** to create an interactive dashboard that explores these relationships. Tooltips provide additional information for each country. The dashboard includes:

* A world map showing each country's data
* A scatter plot comparing GDP and life expectancy
* Tables highlighting the countries with the highest and lowest values for each measure

**Key insights include**:
* A positive relationship between GDP and life expectancy across countries
* The wide range of the number of people using smartphones across countries

This dashboard was originally created during my data analysis training. After a year of further learning and practice, I improved it by focusing on clarity and user experience.
